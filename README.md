## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time aircraft tracking** — Polls OpenSky Network every 90 seconds
- **Clustering** — Aggregates thousands of aircraft into clusters that expand on zoom
- **Country filter** — Dropdown to filter aircraft by origin country
- **Aircraft detail panel** — Click any aircraft to see callsign, ICAO24, altitude, speed, heading
- **Visibility-aware polling** — Pauses when the browser tab is hidden, resumes when visible
- **OAuth2 authentication** — Proxy handles token lifecycle automatically (refresh, retry)
- **OnPush change detection** — Signals-based reactivity with zero manual subscriptions

---

## 🏆 Bonus Features

- **Smooth position interpolation (WIP)**  
  Aircraft positions are animated between polling updates using `requestAnimationFrame`, improving visual continuity.

- **Clustering**  
  Efficient rendering of large datasets using MapLibre's native clustering — circles scale and color by density, with numeric labels. Clicking a cluster zooms in and expands it.

- **Country filtering**  
  Dropdown (Angular Material `mat-select`) to filter aircraft by origin country. Available countries are derived dynamically from live data via a computed signal.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22+
- **Angular CLI** v21+
- An **OpenSky Network** account with API credentials ([create one here](https://opensky-network.org/index.php?option=com_users&view=registration))

---

## 🚀 Installation & Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure API credentials (see section below)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Run the development server
ng serve
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:4200**.

---

## 🔑 API Credentials Setup

OpenSky uses **OAuth2 client credentials** (Basic Auth is no longer accepted).

1. Log in at [opensky-network.org](https://opensky-network.org)
2. Go to **My OpenSky → Account** and create a new API client
3. Copy your `client_id` and `client_secret`
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

The dev proxy (`proxy.conf.js`) reads these at startup, fetches a Bearer token, and auto-refreshes it every 30 minutes. Credentials **never reach the browser**.

> Without credentials the app still works with anonymous access, but rate limits are much stricter (400 credits/day vs 4,000).

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a **feature-based, layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns.

### Data Flow

```
OpenSky API → Proxy (Bearer token) → Repository → Adapter → Store (signals)
                                                                  ↓
                                              Facade ← Polling + Visibility
                                                ↓
                                       MapViewComponent (effect)
                                                ↓
                                     MapService.updateAircraftSource(geojson)
                                                ↓
                                         MapLibre GL (render)
```

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Polling service** fetches aircraft data periodically (every 90 s, visibility-aware)
2. **Adapter** transforms raw API arrays into typed domain models, filtering invalid entries
3. **Store** updates normalized state (`Record<icao24, AircraftState>`) using Angular Signals
4. **GeoJSON** is derived automatically via `computed` selectors — no manual trigger needed
5. **MapService** updates the map source efficiently using `setData()` — layers are never recreated
6. **Empty results are applied** — if the API returns an empty collection, `setData()` is still called to keep the map in sync with the store and avoid showing stale aircraft

## 🗺️ Map Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Tile style | [CartoDB Positron](https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/positron-gl-style/style.json) |
| Default center | `[0, 20]` (Atlantic, 20°N) |
| Default zoom | 2 (world view) |
| Cluster radius | 50 px |
| Cluster max zoom | 14 |

**Three map layers:**
1. `clusters-layer` — Circle markers sized/colored by cluster density
2. `cluster-count-layer` — Numeric labels on clusters
3. `aircraft-layer` — Individual aircraft icons (unclustered points)

## ⚡ Performance

| Optimization | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Polling interval** | 90 s (960 req/day × 4 credits = 3,840 — within 4,000/day limit) |
| **Visibility-aware** | Stops polling when tab is hidden |
| **OnPush** | All components use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` |
| **Signals** | No manual subscriptions — computed selectors update reactively |
| **GeoJSON `setData`** | Source updated in-place — layers/sources never recreated |
| **Normalized state** | `Record<string, AircraftState>` for O(1) lookups |
| **Retry with backoff** | Exponential backoff inside `switchMap` — outer timer never dies |
| **Token warm-cache** | Bearer token refreshed 60 s before expiry — zero latency per request |

### API Credit Budget (Standard User — 4,000/day)

| Query type | Cost | Requests/day at 90s | Daily credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global (no bounding box) | 4 | 960 | 3,840 ✅ |
| Bounding box ≤ 25 sq° | 1 | 960 | 960 |
| Bounding box 25–100 sq° | 2 | 960 | 1,920 |

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

- **Signals over RxJS in UI layer (Strict Separation of Concerns)**  
  Avoids manual subscriptions and reduces memory leaks. **Angular Signals** completely cover the application state and derived selectors (`_aircraftMap`, `aircraftGeoJson`, filters, and selections) as required. **RxJS** is intentionally preserved *only* as an interoperability layer for handling inherently stream-based asynchronous events (like `HttpClient`, `timer` for polling, and the Page Visibility API). This clear boundary ensures RxJS does not leak into UI state, while still leveraging its power for complex orchestrations like `switchMap` request cancellation.

- **Normalized state (`Record<icao24, AircraftState>`)**  
  Enables O(1) lookups and efficient updates.

- **MapLibre integration via MapService**  
  Prevents coupling between UI and rendering engine.

- **GeoJSON `setData()` updates**  
  Avoids re-creating layers, ensuring high performance.

- **Visibility-aware polling**  
  Reduces API usage and improves efficiency.
